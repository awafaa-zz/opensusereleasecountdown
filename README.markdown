# What Is This? #

This is a simple widget for Android devices to display the time remaining for the next openSUSE release. Basically having a local copy of countdown.opensuse.org.

This is based on the tutorial at http://www.helloandroid.com/tutorials/days-xmas-widget-tutorial and the Ubuntu countdown at http://code.google.com/p/natty-narwhal-countdown-widget-for-android/
